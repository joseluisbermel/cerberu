1 - DO NOT CHANGE ANY SKELETON CLASSES.

2 - You must create a class extending ReservationsImporter following **Object Oriented Programming Best Practices**.
3 - This class must load the reservations files "reservations.json" & "reservations.xml" through method "import". File location must be set in var $filePath.
4 - Your class must log start and end of importing process and also every item/reservation imported with method notify in class "InfoLogger".
5 - Your class must log any error that might happen trough notify method in class "ErrorLogger" (example: duplicated reservations).
6 - Class must log these errors: file not found, empty file, or incorrect item (example: empty title or link).
7 - Class must have proper exception handling.
8 - Import process should be able to be executed via CLI (php cli.php).
9 - Your class should import all the items into a MariaDB or MySQL database.

10 - You must create a simple web page with a week selector, where we can see average data per week.
11 - We need the min, average and max values for "pax" and "total" filtered by week.
12 - You can give the image/layout that you like, but at least you need a CSS and a JS (for date selector validation) files
13 - Don't forget that template engines exist :oP.

14 - You can use the libraries that you like to fulfill the requirements.
15 - In all the exercise, you should try to follow PSR-4, PSR-1 and PSR-12 (or PSR-2).
16 - Generally speaking, the more decoupled your code, the better, so do not hesitate to create as many classes as you wish.
